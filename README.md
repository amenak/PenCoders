# PenBook
This application offers a platform for writing, publishing and reading books. Create a connection between authors, editors, publishers and readers.

According to Joseph Epstein, 81% of Americans want to write a book. However, the odds to publish a book is smaller. Having a platform which bring writers, editors and publishers together will surely increase the odds. Having the exact audience to your disposal will ensure the succes of the book.

A similar applications available now is Webook.com, it offers a community for writers and editors with a little chance of communication with a literary agent when the books is done.

Penbook differs by not only giving a helpful community to the writers, but also a platform where the entire process of publishing a book can be done by self-publishing or through a publisher.
